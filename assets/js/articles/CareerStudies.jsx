        While other young people think pursuing a degree in one of the best
        universities in the country is a big achievement, some of the young
        individuals have failed in the whole process due to poor career choice.
        Speaking with Valhalla media group Gremlly Otieno one of the medical and
        surgical students in the best university in Kenya admitted that his
        degree caused him a lot of metal illness which he never realised at
        first. Coming from a successful family career wise this led him to
        choosing a career that he was not interested in but but decided to do it
        due to the pressure of the parents who have found their success in the
        medical industry. Not knowing that the child’s interest in should be put
        first before advising him or her on the careers he or she might want to
        pursue that is where we all get it wrong. "I found myself depressed,
        wanted to be alone and even confused within some years of my studies at
        the varsity because I never wanted to do that course it was just not in
        me my parents had forced me into something that I was not interested in"
        said Gremlly.

        Pressure should be the last thing young people should be put in as they
        undergo career choices after school. when a dad is a doctor for example
        this doesn’t make his son or daughter have interest in being a doctor.
        every individual should have an opportunity to pursue a career that they
        feel comfortable in. this is because the study process needs interest,
        driving force and motivation. This will really help in the reduction of
        the pressure that young individuals find themselves in during their
        campus life a thing that leads most of them engaging in drug and
        substance abuse.

        Parents should play Avery important role in career choices and not force
        them in careers they are not interested in this will at many points lead
        into depression. According to research it is stated that one of the
        major causes of stress among young individuals is wrong career studies
        at the university this leads to mental strain that is caused by lack of
        interest in what they are studying, and this can lead to pressure. young
        individuals are believed to be the leaders of tomorrow, and this calls
        for a success in their education and having the right guidance in their
        youth life. this really helps in determining their tomorrow. Youth with
        mental health disorders often experience difficulties in a variety
        setting including within their families at home, in school and in the
        community. With mental health issues can lead to the young individuals
        facing disciplinary actions in school even and this maybe due to
        disturbed mind which can lead to change of behaviour, thoughts and
        emotions.

        According to statistics 40% of young people suffer mental illness caused
        by anxiety and depression this means approximately out of 10 youths 4
        are mentally ill. we as a society have a role to play in the lives of
        our young generation if we don’t want to lose them taking care of them
        should be a priority in everyone’s life. prevention and early
        intervention in youth mental health should be put into consideration
        before things get out of hand.

        Evidence suggests that it would be unrealistic to consider promotion and
        prevention in mental health professional along. integrated and
        multidisciplinary services are needed to increase the range of possible
        interventions and limit the risk of poor long -term outcome, with also
        potential benefits benefits in terms of healthcare system costs. However
        mental health professional has the scientific, ethical and moral
        responsibility to indicate the direction to all social, political and
        other health care bodies involved in the process of meeting mental
        health needs during youth years. Our careers pursuing process should
        give our young people peace of mind and success in life and not
        disturbed minds.
