        In the recent years, there has been more increase in the acknowledgement
        of the important role of mental health. As it plays a crucial role in
        achieving global development goals, which is illustrated by the
        inclusion of mental health in the Sustainable Development Goals.
        Depression is one of the leading causes by disability of mental health
        and followed by suicide as the second leading cause of death among the
        range of 15­-29 year olds. People with severe mental health conditions
        die prematurely as much as two decades early due to preventable physical
        conditions.

        Despite some progress, people with mental health conditions often
        experience severe human rights violations, discrimination and stigma.
        Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively
        low cost, yet the gap between the people needing care and those with
        access to care remains substantial. Effective treatment coverage remains
        extremely low.

        Increasing investment is required on all fronts for mental health
        awareness and to increase understanding and also to reduce stigma. On
        the other side effort is needed to increase access to quality mental
        health care and effective treatment and the research to identify new
        treatment and improve existing treatment for all mental disorders. In
        2019, World Health Organization (WHO) launched the WHO Special
        Initiative for Mental Health (2019-2023): Universal Health Coverage for
        Mental Health to ensure access to quality and affordable care for mental
        health conditions in 12 priority countries to 100 million more people.
