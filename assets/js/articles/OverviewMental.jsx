        Mental health can have variances in definitions depending on an
        individual’s understanding of what Mental health really is. However, the
        most agreeable definition of mental health is “a state of well-being in
        which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with
        the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and
        is able to make a contribution to his or her community.

        There are several types of mental disorder that influence’s an
        individual’s ability to maximize his or her ability to maximize his or
        her productivity. They range from Depression to Dementia. In this
        article we will however focus more on Bipolar disorder.

        Bipolar Disorder, also referred to as Manic depression causes extreme
        mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows
        (depression). People who are depressed usually feel sad and/or hopeless
        and lose interest in most activities. For instance, a person who
        frequently enjoyed hanging out with his buddies becomes less interested
        all of a sudden and confides himself within a particular environment.
        When one’s mood shifts to mania or hypomania, one feels intensely
        excited and happy, energetic or unusually irritable. These mood swings
        can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgement, behavior and the ability
        to clearly make judgments.

        A person suffering from Bipolar Disorder tends to experience episodes of
        mood swings for a very long time or rarely in a year. Some people will
        experience some emotional symptoms between episodes while others won’t
        experience any. Yes, bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition but one
        can manage his or her mood swings and other symptoms by following a
        treatment plan, which in most cases is treated with medications and
        psychological counselling (psychotherapy).

        They may include mania or hypomania and depression, and behavior,
        resulting in notable distress and difficulties in life.

      <Typography variant="h5">Mania and hypomania</Typography>
      <Typography>
        They are two distinct types of episodes, (mania is more severe than
        hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, social activities
        as well as in relationships). They both have the same symptoms that
        include: Decreased need for sleep, Racing thoughts, Poor decision
        making, Unusual talkativeness, Exaggerated sense of well-being and
        self-confidence.

        There are also symptoms that are severe enough to cause difficulty in
        day to day activities. It is a phase known as the Major depressive
        episode and is characterized by the following symptoms: Depressed mood,
        such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless. It can appear as irritability in
        teens. Loss of interest in most activities that one used to participate
        in.

        With the above overview, we can agree that at a certain point in life,
        we experienced either of those if not all but paid little or no
        attention. Mental awareness is key in one’s growth in all aspects.
        Dominant suicidal thoughts, or any thought of hurting oneself is common
        to people with bipolar disorder. There is a need for one to see a mental
        specialist or advice an individual with the stated symptoms to visit a
        psychiatrist. Let us all remember that the dance of a mad man in the
        market is only funny to those who aren’t his/her kin. Our mental health
        matters!
