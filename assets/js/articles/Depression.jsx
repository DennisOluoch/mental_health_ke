        Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social
        well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps
        determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.
        Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and
        adolescence through adulthood.

        Done with highschool? good, joined the university? That is even better
        but what happens during that period of transition can be detrimental to
        some students&apos; psychological well-being. First and foremost there
        is the culture shock. The university environment is totally different
        from that of highschool therefore the feelings of uncertainty, confusion
        and the periods of frustration may lead to anxiety or even depression.

        Growing up, most of us wanted to be lawyers, doctors, pilots,
        journalists to name but a few but now here we are at the university no
        longer sure if we still want to pursue those careers probably due to the
        grades we got or we are just not interested in them anymore. The
        uncertainty about career paths weighs us down. We do not have anyone to
        talk to so we unknowingly fall into depression.

        All parents want to see their children succeed in life hence put too
        much pressure on them and at the same time the children are pressuring
        themselves to succeed in academics. They have stress of meeting
        deadlines and expectations. This slowly messes up with most
        students&apos; mental health.

        In this new era of technological advancement, a lot goes on on social
        media. Most university students are more or less addicted to social
        media especially WhatsApp, Instagram, Tiktok and Twitter. People out
        here are setting standards on these pages. Vacations, dates, nights out,
        getaways are the order of the day. According to social media, people are
        really enjoying life. A lot of university students tend to compare their
        lives to what is happening on social media. They barely realize that
        most people only post their high moments. They therefore end up putting
        unnecessary pressure on themselves.

        The university life comes with a lot of freedom. Freedom that most
        students have never experienced before. The university environment also
        contains people from all walks of life. Their is definitely too much
        peer pressure especially when it comes to drugs and substance abuse.
        Most students start abusing drugs when they are in the university. The
        availability and affordability of these drugs also encourages the habit.
        Drugs and substance abuse slowly messes up with the mental health of
        these students and without even realizing they get addicted and some
        even fall into depression.

        A big percentage of university students especially the male gender are
        only supported financially by their parents during the first year of
        their studies. When they join the second year, they are seen as grown
        ups who can fend for themselves. Financial worries is therefore one of
        the greatest factor affecting mental health in the universities. Some
        open up businesses and when they boom, they can no longer balance
        schooling and business. Others their businesses barely thrive. In both
        scenarios the students are not in the right state of mind.

        Dealing with mental illness in the universities should be a top
        priority. Creating awareness on mental disorders, the signs, causes and
        consequences these disorders have on people is the very first step.
        Students&apos; wellbeing is essential in fostering a good learning
        environment and wellness campaigns can be quite effective in addressing
        the mental health issues.

        Empowering of students is quite important. The moment these students
        feel loved and respected in that their ideas are listened to and they
        get feedback in short their input is valued it brings out a sense a self
        confidence, self efficacy and an ability to deal with issues around
        them.

        Counseling can go a long way in dealing with mental health issues. As
        stated earlier on many students fall into depression due to uncertainty
        about career paths, parental pressure, social media pressure, substance
        abuse and culture shock. These are issues that can be addressed through
        guidance and counseling. Having these sessions regularly and moreso
        immediately new students are admitted into the universities will save a
        large number from becoming victims of mental illnesses.

        Provision of stress management resources can help address the issue.
        Universities can have gyms where students can exercise, provide
        necessary equipment for different sports and games, set aside rooms for
        entertainment, organize events whereby students can showcase their
        talents, grant permission to students to organize interschool games
        competition and even award the winning teams. Such activities provide an
        opportunity for students to unwind.
      </Typography>

        Dealing with mental health issues can also be a personal initiative.
        Taking preventive measures can save one from going through hell. Talking
        to someone about your feelings helps reduce the mental torture, keeping
        in contact with friends, learning new skills, doing stuff that you
        enjoy, exercising, taking a break from one&apos;s daily routine,
        volunteering and last but not least accepting oneself.

        Students in the universities experience a lot of struggles. The earlier
        the issues are addressed the better since it saves the student from
        experiencing mental disorders that affect performance in the long-run.
