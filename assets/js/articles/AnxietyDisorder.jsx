        An anxiety disorder is a type of mental health condition. If you have an
        anxiety disorder, you may respond to certain things and situations with
        fear and dread. You may also experience physical signs of anxiety, such
        as a pounding heart and sweating.You may feel anxious or nervous if you
        have to tackle a problem at work, go to an interview, take a test or
        make an important decision. And anxiety can even be beneficial. For
        example, anxiety helps us notice dangerous situations and focuses our
        attention, so we stay safe.

      <Typography>
        But an anxiety disorder goes beyond the regular nervousness and slight
        fear you may feel from time to time. An anxiety disorder happens when;
        it interferes with your ability to function, you often overreact when
        something triggers your emotions and you can’t control your responses to
        situations. Anxiety disorders can make it difficult to get through the
        day. Fortunately, there are several effective treatments for anxiety
        disorders.

        Who is at risk for anxiety disorders?
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        A mix of genetic and environmental factors can raise a person’s risk for
        developing anxiety disorders. You may be at higher risk if you have or
        had certain personality traits, such as shyness or behavioral inhibition
        — feeling uncomfortable with, and avoiding, unfamiliar people,
        situations or environments. Stressful or traumatic events in early
        childhood or adulthood. Family history of anxiety or other mental health
        conditions. Certain physical conditions, including thyroid problems and
        heart arrhythmias (unusual heart rhythms). Anxiety disorders occur more
        often in women. Researchers are still studying why that happens. It may
        come from women’s hormones, especially those that fluctuate throughout
        the month. The hormone testosterone may play a role, too — men have
        more, and it may ease anxiety. It’s also possible that women are less
        likely to seek treatment, so the anxiety worsens.

        What are the types of anxiety disorders?
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        There are several types of anxiety disorders, including: Generalized
        anxiety disorder (GAD). Panic disorder. Phobias and Separation anxiety.
        Other mental health conditions share features with anxiety disorders.
        These include post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive
        disorder.

      <Typography variant="h6">
        What is generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)?
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        With GAD, you may feel extreme and unrealistic worry and tension — even
        if there’s nothing to trigger these feelings. Most days, you may worry a
        lot about various topics, including health, work, school and
        relationships. You may feel that the worry continues from one thing to
        the next.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Physical symptoms of GAD can include restlessness, difficulty
        concentrating and sleeping problems.

        What is a panic disorder?
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        If you have a panic disorder, you get intense, sudden panic attacks.
        These attacks often feature stronger, more intense feelings than other
        types of anxiety disorders.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        The feelings of terror may start suddenly and unexpectedly or they may
        come from a trigger, like facing a situation you dread. Panic attacks
        can resemble heart attacks. If there’s any chance you’re experiencing a
        heart attack, go to the emergency room. It’s better to err on the side
        of caution and have a healthcare professional check you.

      <Typography variant="h6">How common are anxiety disorders?</Typography>
      <Typography>
        Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health conditions in the
        U.S. They affect about 40 million Americans. They happen to nearly 30%
        of adults at some point. Anxiety disorders most often begin in
        childhood, adolescence or early adulthood.

      <Typography variant="h6">
        How do anxiety disorders affect children?
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        It’s normal for children to feel some amount of anxiety, worry or fear
        at certain points. For example, a child may feel scared of a
        thunderstorm or barking dog. A teenager might get anxious about an
        upcoming test or school dance.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        But sometimes, children approach these situations with overwhelming
        dread or they can’t stop thinking about all the fears tied to one of
        these events. It may seem that none of your comforts help. These
        children often get “stuck” on their worries. They have a hard time doing
        their daily activities, like going to school, playing and falling
        asleep. They’re extremely reluctant to try something new.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        When thinking about your child’s anxiety levels, “getting stuck” is key.
        It separates the regular worries of childhood from an anxiety disorder
        that needs professional help. If the anxiety or worry interferes with
        your child’s ability to function, it may be time to seek help.

        How does medication treat anxiety disorders?
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Medications can’t cure an anxiety disorder. But they can improve
        symptoms and help you function better. Medications for anxiety disorders
        often include:
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Anti-anxiety medications, such as benzodiazepines, may decrease your
        anxiety, panic and worry. They work quickly, but you can build up a
        tolerance to them. That makes them less effective over time. Your
        healthcare provider may prescribe an anti-anxiety medication for the
        short-term, then taper you off or the provider may add an antidepressant
        to the mix.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Antidepressants can also help with anxiety disorders. They tweak how
        your brain uses certain chemicals to improve mood and reduce stress.
        Antidepressants may take some time to work, so be patient. If you feel
        like you’re ready to stop taking antidepressants, talk to your provider
        first.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Beta-blockers, usually used for high blood pressure, can help reduce
        some of the physical symptoms of anxiety disorders. They can relieve
        rapid heartbeat, shaking and trembling.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Your healthcare provider will work with you to find the right medication
        combination and dosage. Don’t change the dose without consulting your
        provider. They’ll monitor you to make sure the medicines are working
        without causing negative side effects.

        How does psychotherapy treat anxiety disorders?
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Psychotherapy, or counseling, helps you deal with your emotional
        response to the illness. A mental health provider talks through
        strategies to help you better understand and manage the disorder.
        Approaches include:
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which is the most common type of
        psychotherapy used with anxiety disorders. CBT for anxiety teaches you
        to recognize thought patterns and behaviors that lead to troublesome
        feelings. You then work on changing them.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Exposure therapy focuses on dealing with the fears behind the anxiety
        disorder. It helps you engage with activities or situations you may have
        been avoiding. Your provider may also use relaxation exercises and
        imagery with exposure therapy.

        What happens if I don’t get treatment for my child with an anxiety
        disorder?
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Getting your child help for an anxiety disorder can improve their
        development and self-esteem. But untreated anxiety disorders can harm:
        Family relationships, School performance and Social functioning.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Your child may also end up with more serious mental and physical health
        problems. Fortunately, there are several treatments for anxiety
        disorders. The right treatment can help your child manage their symptoms
        and feel their best.
