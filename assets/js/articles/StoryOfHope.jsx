        When people look at me they would see a typical 20 something University
        student, who may come across as a bit reserved, quiet, thoughtful and is
        generally respected amongst his peers. What they would not see are the
        scars I carry. I am not referring to physical scars, but emotional scars
        on the inside.

        I have been struggling with my mental health on and off for many years,
        through various experiences that have been traumatic for me, beginning
        in my early teens and continuing to yo-yo between the highs and the
        extreme lows never really feeling a balance between the two. During my
        periods of being extremely low, I self-harmed and attempted to take my
        own life.

        This was hidden and kept secret from family and close friends for a very
        long time, until one such episode in May this year I finally reached out
        to a close friend who listened and directed me to get professional
        support urgently. I contacted the Guidance and Counselling, who were an
        initial point of support. I felt that by talking to absolute strangers,
        albeit professionals, about things that are so personal and emotional, I
        could go further. I decided that I can and should really be talking to
        those who know me, and opened up to friends, trusted colleagues and
        close family. This was not easy at all and has been one of the hardest
        things I have had to do, to discuss openly after so long that I have
        mental health issues and see their reactions.

        But, the help received from my new support network, my family, friends
        and close colleagues offering to just be there to listen when I am low,
        was overwhelming. My best friend and close family are in contact
        regularly, by phone and in person. At work my manager helps me on a one
        to one basis and supported me in accessing the University’s Guidance and
        Counselling Service. I felt apprehensive about this, but the staff have
        been supportive and the counselling sessions have helped me immensely.

        Personally, the key for me has very much been to be more open and honest
        with myself and to have the courage to access professional services,
        whether they be at the University or other support services. Friends,
        family and trusted colleagues are a great source of support, but I feel
        that professionals trained in these areas are an absolute essential
        means to recognise behaviours, derive at therapies and to help towards
        finding a forward facing direction.

        Even with help it’s a difficult uphill struggle. At times, I feel like I
        keep starting over again. At the time of writing I was going through a
        painful and difficult breakdown of a very important relationship (and
        one of my support network), causing confidences built up to be knocked,
        to which I felt extremely low and had repeat of old habits including
        self-harm. Relapses happen and I know that. But, even when I am again at
        my lowest, I just keep talking and letting the emotions out, bottling
        them up is not the right solution from my experience. There is no quick
        fix, it’s a long game, with hurdles along the way and I just kept
        picking myself up to move on.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        I cannot emphasis enough the importance of getting a trusted support
        network and accessing professional services when needed. Without them I
        honestly don’t think I would still be here. From my experiences I’ve
        learnt that there is no shame in having a mental health issue. After
        opening up and talking honestly the sense of fear gradually begins to
        fade. I know that it’s not easy at all, it takes courage to take that
        initial step to say ‘I have a mental health issue, please help me.
